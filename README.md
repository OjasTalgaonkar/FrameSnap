<sup><sub>For your convenience, I have added a folder ImagesToBeSorted in the main directory which contains some of my own nature photography and digital art that you can sort for testing</sub></sup>

Use the arrows on the gallery to navigate between images

The gallery has two functions of its own in the "Functions" tab:

1)Go Back-> This function takes you back to the Categories display

2)Remove Image-> This function removes the current image from your category

3)Set Cover-> Sets the category cover to the current image.

Note: The cover usually changes automatically upon adding new images, but once a cover is set manually, the cover wont change automatically again.

Future Improvements
</p>

1. Maybe adding a way to crop/resize and edit images in the gallery window.

2. Right now , saving is done by writing the urls to the images. This poses the problem of images dissapearing once the location is changed. So in the near future, maybe an internal memory will be developed where images themselves are stored

3. Adding a slideshow option and a way to share these images to certain platforms

4. Adding an inbuilt CLI to the app for more interesting navigation

5. Improving the UI/UX
