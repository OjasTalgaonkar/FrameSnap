Hello, welcome to SnapFrame

This is an instructions manual to navigate this app.

On the Landing page, click on the "Go to Images" button to enter the main page


Once on the main page, you can access the image categories

Some of the image categories have been named for you and some are left for you to name.
You can rename any of them by selecting an image category and clicking on "File->Rename Category"

If you want to add images to them, select the category and click on "File-> Import Images"
(You can only add one at a time)

To see the images , select the category and click on "File-> Open Category" to open a viewing gallery

In the viewing Gallery, you can delete images by clicking on "File-> Remove Image" and go back to main page by clicking "File-> Go back"

That is all the features currently available, new changes might be added in the future, so check out the github linked at the bottom to keep up with updates

Notes:
1) right now, there are no save features, so once you close the app, all your organizing dissapears

2) In case you dont have a set of images lying around to sort, I have provided an ImagesToBeSorted folder in the project consisting of some of my art pieces and photography that you can sort
